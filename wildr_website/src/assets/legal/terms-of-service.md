<a id="DISPUTE_RESOLUTION_AND_ARBITRATION"></a>

### 21. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH WILDR
AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.

<ol type="a">
<li>Binding Arbitration</li>

Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively,
&quot;Disputes&quot;) in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks
injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without
limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Wildr agree (a) to waive your
and Wildr&#39;s respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to this Agreement, use of our
Website, App, or Platform, resolved in a court, and (b) to waive your and Wildr&#39;s respective rights to a jury trial.
Instead, you and Wildr agree to arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to
one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it
instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or a jury in court).

<li>No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions</li>

You and Wildr agree that any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms of Service or use or access of our
Website, App, or Platform is personal to you and Wildr and that such Dispute will be resolved solely through individual
arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.
You and Wildr agree that there will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a
Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, you and Wildr agree that a Dispute
cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on
behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.

<li>Federal Arbitration Act</li>

You and Wildr agree that these Terms of Service affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section
shall be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal
Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the &quot;FAA&quot;), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

<li>Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution</li>

You and Wildr agree that each party will notify the other party in writing of any arbitral or small claims Dispute
within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute
informally. Notice to Wildr shall be sent by certified mail or courier to Wildr, Attn: [CONTACT PERSON]
, [PHYSICAL ADDRESS]. Your notice must include (a) your name, postal address, telephone number, the email address you
use or used for your Wildr account and, if different, an email address at which you can be contacted, (b) a description
in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that you are seeking. Our notice
to you will be sent electronically in accordance with this Agreement and will include (x) our name, postal address,
telephone number and an email address at which we can be contacted with respect to the Dispute, (y) a description in
reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (z) the specific relief that we are seeking. If you and
Wildr cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the
applicable party, then either you or Wildr may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section, commence an
arbitration proceeding.

<li> Process</li>

EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES IN WHICH EITHER PARTY SEEKS TO BRING AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT OR SEEKS INJUNCTIVE
OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FOR THE ALLEGED UNLAWFUL USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, TRADE NAMES, LOGOS, TRADE SECRETS OR PATENTS, YOU AND WILDR AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE MUST BE
COMMENCED OR FILED BY YOU OR WILDR WITHIN (1) YEAR OF THE DATE THE DISPUTE AROSE, OTHERWISE THE UNDERLYING CLAIM IS
PERMANENTLY BARRED (WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AND WILDR WILL NO LONGER HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT SUCH CLAIM REGARDING THE
DISPUTE). You and Wildr agree that  (a) any arbitration will occur in Santa Clara County, California, (b) arbitration
will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the
Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the &quot;AAA Rules&quot;) then in effect, except as modified by
this &quot;Dispute Resolution&quot; section, and (c) that the state or federal courts of the State of California, have
exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. You may also litigate a Dispute in
the small claims court located in the county of your billing address if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard
in small claims court.

<li> Authority of Arbitrator</li>

As limited by the FAA, these Terms of Service and the applicable AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive
authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the
determination of whether a Dispute is arbitral, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be
available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or
a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms of Service. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual
arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual&#39;s claims, preside over any type of class or

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p class="p2-text">Wildr’s mission is to create a global troll-free social network that incentivizes positive interactions and good speech. As we grow, we are committed to maintaining a supportive environment for our community. Our Community Guidelines define a set of norms and common code of conduct for Wildr; they provide guidance on what is and is not allowed to make a welcoming space for everyone.<br><br>At Wildr, we prioritize safety, diversity, inclusion, and authenticity. We encourage creators to celebrate what makes them unique and viewers to engage in what inspires them; and we believe that a safe, troll-free environment helps everyone express themselves openly. We deeply value the diverse nature of our community, and we strive to take into account the breadth of cultural norms where we operate. We also aim to cultivate an environment for genuine interactions by only allowing authentic content on Wildr.<br><br>Our Community Guidelines apply to everyone and to everything on Wildr. We proactively enforce them using a mix of technology and human moderation before content gets reported to us. We also encourage our community members to use the in-app reporting functionality to report any content they believe violates our Community Guidelines.<br><br>We will remove any content – including video, audio, livestream, images, comments, and text – that violates our Community Guidelines. Individuals are notified of our decisions and can appeal if they believe no violation has occurred. We will suspend or ban accounts and/or devices that are involved in severe or repeated violations; we will consider information available on other platforms and offline in these decisions. When warranted, we will report the accounts to relevant legal authorities.<br><br>Our algorithms are designed with trust and safety in mind. For some content – such as spam, videos under review, or videos that could be considered upsetting or depict things that may be shocking to a general audience – we may reduce discoverability, including by redirecting search results or limiting distribution in the feed.<br><br>We recognize that some content that would normally be removed per our Community Guidelines could be in the public interest. Therefore, we may allow exceptions under certain circumstances, such as educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic content, satirical content, content in fictional settings, counterspeech, and content in the public interest that is newsworthy or otherwise enables individual expression on topics of social importance.<br><br>In consultation with relevant stakeholders, we update our Community Guidelines from time to time to evolve alongside new behaviors and risks, as part of our commitment to keeping Wildr a safe place for creativity and joy.</p>
